**Outboxer** is a battle tested implementation of the [**transactional outbox pattern**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/cloud-design-patterns/transactional-outbox.html) for **Ruby on Rails** applications.

It addresses the [**dual write problem**](https://www.confluent.io/blog/dual-write-problem/), ensuring **reliable, at-least-once delivery** of messages across distributed systems such as SQL and Redis, RabbitMQ or Kafka.

# Installation

1. Add gem to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'outboxer'
```

2. Install gem:

```bash
bundle install
```

3. Generate schema, publisher, and tests

```bash
bin/rails g outboxer:install
```

4. Migrate database:

```bash
bin/rails db:migrate
```

# Usage

1. Create queued outboxer message after model creation

Add an `after_create` callback to your messageable model e.g.

```ruby
# app/models/event.rb

class Event < ApplicationRecord
  after_create { Outboxer::Message.queue(messageable: self) }
end
```

This ensures the outboxer messageable is created within the **same transaction** as your model e.g.

```irb
irb(main):001:0> Event.create!
  TRANSACTION              (0.2ms)  BEGIN
  Event Create             (1.0ms)  INSERT INTO "events" ...
  Outboxer::Message Create (0.8ms)  INSERT INTO "outboxer_messages" ...
  TRANSACTION              (0.3ms)  COMMIT
=> #<Event id: 1, ...>
```

2. Publish queued outboxer messages

Refer to the generated `bin/outboxer_publisher`:

```ruby
# bin/outboxer_publisher

Outboxer::Publisher.publish_message do |message|
  # TODO: publish message here
end
```

# Management UI

Outboxer ships with a simple web interface to monitor publishers and messages.

## Rails Mounting

```ruby
# config/routes.rb

require 'outboxer/web'

Rails.application.routes.draw do
  mount Outboxer::Web, at: '/outboxer'
end
```

## Rack Mounting

```ruby
# config.ru

map '/outboxer' do
